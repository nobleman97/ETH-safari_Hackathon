# Safari Text

Safari Text is a service that allows users of Ethereum non-custodial Ethereum wallets to query and interact with their accounts using SMS.

## Demo

<center>
 <iframe width="560" 
         height="315" 
         src="YOUTUBE_LINK" 
         title="https://youtu.be/rpLsSL4uHjY" 
         frameborder="0" 
         allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
         allowfullscreen>
 </iframe>
</center>


## How it's built

Safari Text uses web3-onboard on the front-end to connect to Ethereum wallets, Firebase Cloud Functions and Firestore Database as back-end services, and Twilio Messaging to broker Notifications.
